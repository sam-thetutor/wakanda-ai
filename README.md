## Background Story
Wakanda AI was born from the vision of bridging the technological divide in Africa by making blockchain technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. Named after the fictional technologically advanced African nation, Wakanda AI embodies the spirit of African innovation and progress.

The idea emerged when we realized that while blockchain technology holds immense potential for financial inclusion and economic growth in Africa, many Africans face barriers to entry due to technical complexity and language limitations. WhatsApp, being widely used across the continent, presented itself as the perfect platform to democratize access to blockchain technology.

## Mission
To empower Africans by providing simple, accessible, and culturally relevant blockchain solutions through familiar communication channels, enabling everyone to participate in the digital economy regardless of their technical background or primary language.

## Vision
To become Africa's leading AI-powered blockchain interface, creating a future where every African can easily participate in the digital economy using their preferred local language.
