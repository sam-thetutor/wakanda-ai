</p>

A USSD and SMS-based blockchain interface that enables anyone with a basic mobile phone to interact with the Aptos blockchain in their preferred language (English, French, or Kiswahili). Built for Africa, it provides PIN-protected wallet management through USSD menus and natural language blockchain interactions via SMS.

## Background Story

The idea emerged when we realized that while blockchain technology holds immense potential for financial inclusion and economic growth in Africa, many Africans face barriers to entry due to technical complexity and language limitations. SMS, being widely used across the continent, presented itself as the perfect platform to democratize access to blockchain technology.

## Mission

To empower Africans by providing simple, accessible, and culturally relevant blockchain solutions through familiar communication channels, enabling everyone to participate in the digital economy regardless of their technical background or primary language.

## Vision

To become Africa's leading AI-powered blockchain interface, creating a future where every African can easily participate in the digital economy using their preferred local language.
